"""
Connectables implement a mini-language for connecting to supported harnesses.

They allow connecting to various kinds of harnesses over different
"connectors", for example:

    * in a container which Bowtie manages (starts and stops)
    * in a pre-existing / externally managed container (not yet implemented)
    * in-memory within Bowtie itself, with no IPC (not yet implemented)

The general form of a connectable is:

    [<connector>:]<id>[:<arguments>*]

where the connector indicates how to connect to the harness.

The currently supported connectors are:

    * ``image``: a container image which Bowtie will start, stop and delete
                 which must speak Bowtie's harness protocol
    * ``container``: an external running container which Bowtie will connect to
                 which must speak Bowtie's harness protocol

If no connector is specified, ``image`` is assumed.

The ``id`` is interpreted in a connector-specific manner and should indicate
the specific intended implementation. For example, for container images, it
must be the name of a container image which will be pulled if needed.
It need not be fully qualified (i.e. include the repository),
and will default to pulling from Bowtie's own image repository.

Connectables are loosely inspired by `Twisted's strports
<twisted.internet.endpoints.clientFromString`.
